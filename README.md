# CSC139MemAlloc
This repository is a staging area for my 2nd project for CSC 139, the Linux Memory Allocator. This project is written in C and some of the requirements include a fixed umem.h, tests in main, and a umem.c file. This class was at California State University, Sacramento during the Fall 2024 semester.
